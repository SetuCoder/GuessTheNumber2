# GuessTheNumber2
Time for the second version of the original game now with GUI (ok no one asked but I promise this version is epic lol)! Now with more features like double tap to change colour, tons of new animations and UI elements made in HTML, CSS and JS!

The number which the game has set aside for you to guess is in the console window ;)
